##Emoji One Fonts

There's no better way to port our emoji into your device than through a native font.  We don't have the resources ourselves to construct fonts, so we'll depend on helpful contributions from the open source community.

Mac OS Instructions:
Using the latest OS (El Capitan), I was able to load this emoji file in less than a minute.  The original emoji ttf is located in system/library/fonts, do not touch this.  You can safely upload the renamed file (from emojione-apple.ttf, to Apple Color Emoji.ttf) to the /library/fonts folder.  That file will override the default.  This was my experience, but yours may vary.  If someone could create a video and/or web-site guide, we'd gladly link to it.

iOS Instructions:
Search for “EmojiOne 2016” on Cydia and apply with BytaFont. Cydia is a software application for iOS that enables a user to find and install software packages on jailbroken iOS devices (iPhone, iPod, iPad).
